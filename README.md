# Reference Designs

Iliad is an open source SoC architecture based on RISC-V and planned for self-driving car industry.
The SoC will mainly contain separated processing units, one will be a quad-core superscalar RISC-V based on Capablanca Architecture that will be responsible for the high performance computing and the other will be a simpler dual-core RISC-V based on PULPissimo architecture.


# Documentation

The documentation for the Iliad processor is kept in Google Docs
